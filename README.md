# Neural Network Pricing Model - Maximize Profit

## Overview

The **Neural Network Pricing Model - Maximize Profit** is a machine learning project designed to help businesses optimize their pricing strategies to maximize profit. This project leverages neural networks, a subset of deep learning, to create predictive models that can estimate the optimal prices for products or services. By using historical data, this model can help businesses make data-driven decisions to set prices that lead to increased profitability.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and visualization)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for building and training neural networks)
- NumPy, pandas, and other necessary libraries (requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Neural-Network-Pricing-Model-Maximise-Profit.git
   ```

2. Change the directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Neural-Network-Pricing-Model-Maximise-Profit
   ```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Before you can train the pricing model, you need to prepare your data. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect historical data on your product or service prices and relevant features such as demand, competition, and seasonality.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features that can help the model learn patterns in your data.

4. **Data Splitting**: Split your data into training and testing datasets to evaluate model performance.

### Training the Model

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for model training.

2. Load your prepared dataset.

3. Create and configure your neural network model. You can experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the best model for your pricing problem.

4. Train the model using the training dataset.

5. Monitor the training process, and save the trained model weights.

### Making Predictions

Once you have a trained model, you can use it to make pricing predictions for new products or services. Follow these steps:

1. Load the trained model weights.

2. Prepare input data for the product or service you want to price.

3. Use the model to predict the optimal price.

## Configuration

You can customize various aspects of the neural network and pricing model by modifying configuration files and hyperparameters. Explore the configuration options in the project to adapt the model to your specific needs.

## Results and Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance by comparing its predictions to the actual prices and measuring relevant metrics, such as profit, revenue, or margin. Visualize the results to gain insights into how the model's pricing recommendations can maximize profit for your business.
